    <h2 class="h4 text-secondary mt-4">Why Do We Need Disposable Email Addresses?</h2>
    <p class="lh-lg">
      Everyone uses email daily for various purposes—whether it's communicating with coworkers, staying in touch with friends, shopping, or subscribing to services. Almost every app or website we interact with today requires an email address. From loyalty programs and contests to signing up for online services, it’s hard to avoid giving out your email.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-lg">
      However, while owning an email address is necessary, the constant influx of spam can be overwhelming. Many stores and websites store email addresses, and when their databases are compromised, your personal email is at risk. This is where <strong>disposable email addresses</strong> help you protect your inbox and identity.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="h4 text-secondary mt-4">What is a Disposable Email Address?</h2>
    <p class="lh-lg">
      A <strong>disposable email address (DEA)</strong> is a temporary, self-destructing email address that can be used to sign up for services without revealing your real identity. These temporary addresses are generated instantly and stay valid for a short period of time.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-lg">
      If the temporary email starts receiving spam, you can delete it with no consequences. Use it, get what you need, and move on — all without sacrificing your privacy.
    </p>
